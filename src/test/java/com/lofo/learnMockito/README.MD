#Hello
The objective of this project is to train you in unit tests. Two packages are available: solution and training.
In the training package you will find all the classes with comments specifying the steps to follow.
In the solution package, you will have the same classes developed and commented with some tips and useful information.

The solutions presented are not unique and you can surely do better. If you think so don't hesitate to push your version of the solution. I would be happy to read it and why not modify the project to improve it.
#Enjoy!
