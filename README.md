# MockitoBootcamp

Hello,

Welcome to the MockitoBootcamp app. This application provides a working base allowing you to implement unit, acceptance and integration tests to improve the quality of your code.

#Â What does the application do?

You can start it by running the com.lofo.learnMockito.LearnMockitoApplication class. You will then have access to a swagger interface by following the url http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Once on the swagger interface, you have two options. Add a task or view all tasks. Tasks will be saved in an on-board H2 database.

This application can serve as a model for all your training. It provides you with a healthy and simple working basis.

I hope you enjoy my work.

# What i need ?

You only need Java 8, Maven and LombokPlugin on your IDE.
